### Hi there 

I'm Oliver - a PhD student at UofG working in optical neuromorphics ðŸ§ .

I'm interested in neuromorphics, photonic computing, and meta-learning. I'm currently working on novel optimisation methods for photonic neuromorphic systems.

Check out the [Machine Learning in Science](https://ml-in-science.github.io/webpage) colloquia we run - there are loads of interesting talks over there.
